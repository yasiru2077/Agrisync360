          Spider Plant: A Houseplant Marvel
        </h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Spider plant, Chlorophytum comosum, is one of the most common and
          well-known of all houseplants... Spider plant, Chlorophytum comosum,
          is one of the most common and well-known of all houseplants. It is
          especially popular with beginners, being easy to grow and propagate,
          tolerant of neglect, and able to thrive in nearly any type of
          condition. It gets its common name from the small plantlets produced
          on long trailing stems that vaguely resemble spiders. This
          clump-forming, perennial, herbaceous plant, native to coastal areas of
          South Africa, has narrow, strap-shaped leaves arising from a central
          point. The leaves may be solid green or variegated with lengthwise
          stripes of white or yellow. The leaves are not flat, but appear
          channeled or folded down the middle. Plants grows 12-15″ tall. The
          thick, fleshy roots and rhizomes evolved to store water, allowing it
          to survive inconsistent watering. Spider plant produces small white
          flowers. Spider plant produces small white flowers. Long, wiry stems
          up to 2 feet long are produced, sometimes with a few small leaves,
          especially in response to short days and long, uninterrupted nights
          for at least three weeks, although they may appear at any time of year
          indoors. Small white, star-shaped flowers are produced at the ends of
          the stems. After flowering, more leaves are produced at the end of the
          stems, forming small plantlets. If a flower is pollinated, a leathery,
          3-angled capsule-type fruit is produced that contains flat black
          seeds. Spider plant helps clean indoor air. Spider plant helps clean
          indoor air. Studies have shown that spider plant is quite effective in
          cleaning indoor air by absorbing chemicals including formaldehyde,
          xylene, benzene, and carbon monoxide in homes or offices. Thick,
          fleshy roots allow spider plant to tolerate inconsistent watering.
          Thick, fleshy roots allow spider plant to tolerate inconsistent
          watering. Spider plant is very easy to grow indoors in medium to
          bright light throughout the year. It does well with average humidity
          and cool to average temperature, although it can tolerate warmer
          conditions. Use a general-purpose potting soil or soilless medium.
          Plants grow and produce plantlets best when slightly pot-bound.
          Because they grow quickly and the roots can easily become too crowded,
          they need frequent repotting to do their best. Spider plant is well
          suited to hanging containers. Spider plant is well suited to hanging
          containers. Allow the soil to dry slightly between thorough waterings.
          Fertilizing every 3-4 months is usually sufficient, or feed more
          frequently using half strength fertilizer solution. Be aware that
          heavily fertilized plants may not form as many plantlets and excessive
          fertilizer may lead to tip browning. Spider plant generally has few
          pest problems other than scale insects and mealybugs. Tip burn of the
          leaves is a common problem that can have many causes. Low humidity,
          excessively dry soil, salt accumulation and/or chemicals, particularly
          fluoride or chlorine, in tap water may cause brown leaf tips. Using
          distilled or rainwater will help prevent tip browning. Overwatering or
          planting in poorly drained soils can lead to root rot. Spider plant
          can be grown as a ground cover outdoors in warmer climates. Spider
          plant can be grown as a ground cover outdoors in warmer climates. This
          plant can also be grown outdoors as an annual in cool climates. It
          does well in most well-drained soils and should be bedded out after
          the last frost. Spider plant is a good addition to containers with its
          grass-like foliage that makes a nice contrast to other foliage types.
          It is quite well suited to a hanging basket, where the stems can hang
          down. Outdoors they need bright light but can sunburn if grown in full
          sun. In warmer climates, they make a nice ground cover in partly
          shaded areas in the garden. Spider plant is easy to propagate. Spider
          plant is easy to propagate. Spider plants are extremely easy to
          propagate by planting the “spiders” or plantlets that succeed the
          flowers in their own pots. Set the plantlet, still attached to the
          mother plant, on the surface of a pot filled with soilless potting
          medium and allow it to root before severing the stem connecting it to
          the mother plant. A bent paper clip or piece of wire can be used to
          hold the plantlet in contact with the soil until it develops roots.
          Or, select a plantlet that has already started to develop roots and
          pot that up. Larger plants can also be divided. They can also be grown
          from seed but the seedlings will not necessarily have the same leaf
          coloration as the parent. Some varieties include: ‘Milky Way’ has
          leaves with green margins and a broad white to cream center, creating
          a much lighter overall appearance than other cultivars. ‘Vittatum’ has
          dark green leaves with a wide, creamy white stripe down the center of
          each leaf. It tends to be slower growing than the green types.
          ‘Variegatum’ has relatively broad green leaves with white margins.
          This cultivar tends to produce fewer plantlets than other types.
          ‘White Stripe’ has a narrow white to cream line down the central leaf
          vein that is lost as the leaf ages. The flower stalks are cream to
          yellowish instead of the normal green.
